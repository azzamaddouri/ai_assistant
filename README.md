# AI Assistant Using Gemini

## Overview

This project showcases an AI Assistant App built with Google Gemini.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Gemini API

To use the Gemini API, you'll need to create an API Key via Google AI Studio. Follow this link to get a free API key:
[Google AI Studio - API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

You have two options for managing your API key:

1. **Static Configuration**: You can statically pass the API key in the `helpers/global.dart` file.
2. **Secure Storage**: For better security, you can store the API key in a database. To do this, follow these steps:
   - Create a free project on [Appwrite](https://www.appwrite.io/).
   - Inside your project, create a new database.
   - Add a new attribute, then create a new collection.
   - Finally, add a new document to store your API key.
